# Supabase Authentication Setup Guide

This guide covers the manual configuration of Supabase authentication for the FluffyPet platform. Since you've already configured Supabase manually, this serves as documentation for your current setup.

## Current Configuration Status ✅

Your Supabase project should now be configured with:

### URL Configuration
- **Site URL**: Set to your production domain
- **Redirect URLs**: Configured for production, development, and preview deployments

### Email Templates
- **Confirm Signup**: Updated with correct callback URLs
- **Magic Link**: Configured for dashboard redirect
- **Reset Password**: Set to redirect to reset password page
- **Email Change**: Configured for email change confirmation

### Security Settings
- **Rate Limiting**: Configured appropriately
- **JWT Settings**: Set with proper expiry times
- **Email Confirmations**: Enabled

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these environment variables are set in your deployment:

\`\`\`bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Site Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-production-domain.com

# Additional Services
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-maps-key
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your-razorpay-key-id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your-razorpay-secret
\`\`\`

## Authentication Flow

The platform now uses these authentication flows:

### 1. User Registration
- User signs up with email/password
- Confirmation email sent with callback to `/auth/callback`
- After confirmation, user redirected to `/onboarding`

### 2. User Login
- User signs in with email/password
- Successful login redirects to `/dashboard`
- Failed login shows error message

### 3. Password Reset
- User requests password reset
- Reset email sent with link to `/reset-password`
- User sets new password and is redirected to dashboard

### 4. OAuth (if configured)
- Google/GitHub OAuth available
- Redirects to `/auth/callback` then `/dashboard`

## Testing Checklist

Since configuration is complete, verify these flows work:

- [ ] User registration with email confirmation
- [ ] User login with valid credentials
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] OAuth login (if configured)
- [ ] Email delivery in production
- [ ] Proper redirects after authentication
- [ ] Error handling for invalid credentials

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Supabase Logs**
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to Logs → Auth logs
   - Look for authentication errors

2. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - Ensure all required variables are set
   - Check that URLs match your deployment

3. **Test Email Delivery**
   - Check spam folders
   - Verify email templates are correct
   - Test with different email providers

4. **Check Redirect URLs**
   - Ensure exact URLs are configured in Supabase
   - Verify HTTPS is used in production
   - Test with different browsers
